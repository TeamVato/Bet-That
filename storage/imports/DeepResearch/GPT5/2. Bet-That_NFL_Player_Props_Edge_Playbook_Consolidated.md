# Bet‑That NFL Player Props Edge Playbook — **Consolidated Edition**
**Version:** 2025-09-25 · **Audience:** Internal (shareable later) · **Scope:** NFL Player Props (2018–2025 focus, incl. playoffs)

---

## Executive Summary
This playbook consolidates our research on **repeatable edge‑finding methods** for NFL player props. It synthesizes football analytics (scheme, personnel, efficiency) with betting market behavior (pricing, line movement, correlation) to produce **actionable, median‑based projections**, **EV thresholds**, and an **implementation plan** for the Bet‑That engine.  
Key principles:
- Use **medians (not means)** for prop comparisons; simulate or transform distributions before comparing to sportsbook lines.  
- Prefer **multiple independent signals** (usage, weather, scheme, matchup, pace) to avoid single‑stat traps.  
- Bias toward **unders** unless evidence shows sustained usage/efficiency gains; public and pricing often tilt lines upward.  
- Enforce **fractional Kelly** sizing and **correlation controls** (per‑game exposure caps).  
- Validate everything via **backtest (2018–2024)**, with **playoff** and **conference/non‑conference** cuts. Continuously monitor CLV and per‑signal ROI.

## Glossary (quick)
- **EV%**: Expected value as percent of stake given our win probability vs implied.  
- **Kelly fraction**: Fraction of full Kelly bet size used to limit drawdowns (e.g., 0.5× Kelly).  
- **Median vs Mean**: Sportsbooks price medians; DFS projections often provide means. Convert or simulate to align.  
- **PROE**: Pass Rate Over Expectation (situation‑adjusted pass aggressiveness).  
- **Situation‑neutral pace**: Seconds per play in neutral score/time situations (proxy for total play volume).

## Signals Taxonomy (Proven vs. Hype)
**How to read:** Each signal lists **Definition**, **Data**, **Compute/Heuristic**, **Effect (dir./size)**, **Pitfalls**, **Status**. “Proven” = robust/validated; “Experimental” = promising but needs more validation; “Hype” = deprioritized.

### Volume & Usage
| Signal | Definition | Data | Compute / Heuristic | Effect (Dir./Size) | Pitfalls | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Usage/Role Shift** | Snap/routes/target/carry share materially changes (injury, depth chart, coordinator) | Snaps, routes, target & carry share; depth chart; news | Compare last 1–3 games vs season; if +20–30% role delta, adjust median; redistribute teammates | **Strong**; shifts can add/subtract 10–30% to medians | Small samples; coach‑speak; committee risk | **Proven** |
| **Injury Fallout** | Teammate injury elevates or depresses usage | Inactives; practice reports; beat notes | When starter out: promote backup usage based on historical substitution rates; adjust efficiency | Often **strong**; first market windows most +EV | Already priced if early news; late limits | **Proven** |
| **Designed QB Runs** | Team increases called runs for QB (not scrambles) | Play‑by‑play tags; coach quotes | If designed runs ≥4–5/g recently, bump QB rush yards attempts/median | **Strong** until market catches up | Injury risk; may revert vs spy defenses | **Experimental** |

### Environment & Context
| Signal | Definition | Data | Compute / Heuristic | Effect (Dir./Size) | Pitfalls | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Wind** | Sustained wind ≥15–20 mph (outdoors) suppresses passing/kicking | Stadium forecast (hourly); venue | Tiers: 10–15 light; 15–20 moderate (–5–10% pass yards); 20+ severe (–15–25%); boost rush attempts | **Strong under** bias for pass/kick | Forecast error; market moves; short‑pass resilience | **Proven** |
| **Precip/Temp** | Heavy rain/snow; extreme cold/heat | Hourly precip/temp; field type | Apply modest efficiency penalties; combine w/ wind; bump RB carries | **Moderate**; weaker than wind | Overreaction to light snow; double‑count | **Proven (tempered)** |
| **Rest Discrepancy** | Short week vs extra rest (bye) | Schedule days rest | –3–5% efficiency on short‑rest offense; slight + for extra‑rest offense | **Mild** | Mostly priced into spreads; prop impact small | **Support/Tie‑breaker** |

### Scheme, Pace, Matchups
| Signal | Definition | Data | Compute / Heuristic | Effect (Dir./Size) | Pitfalls | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Situation‑Neutral Pace** | Plays per game via sec/play (neutral) | Sec/play ranks; splits | Combine both teams; ±5–10 plays vs avg shifts volume 5–10% | **Moderate–Strong** volume effect | Totals partially price pace; garbage time | **Proven** |
| **PROE / Early‑Down Pass%** | Pass aggressiveness controlling for situation | PROE; ED pass% | If top‑5 PROE/ED pass vs neutral, bump QB/WR attempts/yds 5–7% | **Moderate–Strong** | Game script overrides; redundancy w/ totals | **Proven** |
| **Personnel (11/12/13/21)** | Distribution of WR/TE/RB groupings | Weekly personnel % | Big shifts (≥+10%) reallocate targets/snaps across positions | **Moderate–Strong** for specific players | Opponent‑driven game plans; injuries | **Proven** |
| **OL–DL Pressure Mismatch** | Pass block vs pass rush disparity | PBWR/PRWR; pressure%; injuries | If expected pressure ≥35–40% dropbacks: down QB/WR aDOT/yds; up sacks; up RB/TE receptions | **Strong** (matchup‑specific) | Mobile QBs scramble; garbage time yards | **Proven** |
| **Coverage Funnel (Man/Zone)** | Defense scheme shifts target distribution | Man/zone rates; WR/RB/TE splits | vs Man: boost QB rush & WR1; vs Zone: boost slot/RB/TE receptions | **Moderate** | Noisy splits; hybrid looks | **Experimental** |
| **Divisional Rematch** | Familiarity in 2nd/3rd meeting | Prior game plan/results | Lean unders on inflated stars; expect adjustments | **Moderate** | Market may price some; small sample | **Support** |
| **Conference vs Non‑Conf** | Familiarity/variance difference | Schedule; historical | Adjust confidence (uncertain edges need higher EV in non‑conf) | **Mild** | Mixed historical signals | **Support** |

### Market Structure & Behavior
| Signal | Definition | Data | Compute / Heuristic | Effect (Dir./Size) | Pitfalls | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Projection Δ vs Line** | Median projection vs market line | Our medians; book lines | Simulate win‑prob; compute EV; fire if ≥ threshold | **Core** | Model misspecification | **Proven** |
| **Line Shopping** | Inter‑book discrepancies | Multi‑book odds/lines | Always bet best price/number; gains 2–5% ROI over season | **Core** | Limits; speed | **Proven** |
| **Steam/Move Reading** | Interpreting sharp/news moves | Line histories; timestamps | If info‑driven, follow; if hype‑driven, fade/caution | **Situational** | False signals; late traps | **Support** |
| **Primetime Bias** | Public over‑lean in island games | Ticket splits; shading | Only use if our median ≪ line; small under edge | **Mild** | Not reliable player‑wise | **Hype (pricing only)** |
| **Hot‑Hand/“Form”** | Recent streak implies future | Game logs | Avoid unless usage changed; usually fade inflation | **Small contrarian** | Miss true breakouts | **Hype** |
| **Revenge Narrative** | Player vs old team | Schedule | Ignore unless accompanied by real usage/scheme edge | — | Anecdotal | **Hype** |

> **Takeaway:** We prioritize **Usage/Injury**, **Weather (wind)**, **Pace/PROE**, **Personnel**, **OL–DL pressure**, and **Projection vs Line** as our **core proven** set. Coverage funnels, designed QB runs, and divisional dynamics are **add‑ons** with measured weights. “Hot hand,” “revenge,” and raw primetime narratives are **de‑weighted**.

## Threshold Profiles (EV / Kelly / Correlation)
Use profiles to **gate bets** and **size stakes**. Default to **Moderate** once validated; start **Conservative** early season.

| Profile | Min EV% to Bet | Fractional Kelly | Max Game Correlation | Confidence Rules |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **Conservative** | ≥ **5%** | **0.25× Kelly** | ≤ **0.30** | Require **≥2 independent signals**; skip if major uncertainty (Q‑tag, weather swing). Prefer best numbers early; otherwise wait. |
| **Moderate** | ≥ **3%** | **0.50× Kelly** | ≤ **0.50** | ≥1 key signal (model) and no contradictions; halve stake with uncertainty; diversify across positions/games. |
| **Aggressive** | ≥ **1–2%** | **0.75–1.0× Kelly** | ≤ **0.80** | Allow single strong signal; fire early; relax correlation but cap per‑game risk; accept higher variance. |

**Notes:**  
- **EV%** example at -110: breakeven 52.38%. If our P(win)=58%, EV ≈ 58%×0.909 − 42% ≈ +10.7%.  
- **Kelly sizing**: Stake_kelly ≈ (P × (odds−1) − (1−P)) / (odds−1); use a **fraction** (0.25–0.5 typical).  
- **Correlation**: QB over & WR over ~0.6–0.8. Prefer choosing one or splitting units to avoid “game‑script” overexposure.

---

## Backtest Design (2018–2024, incl. playoffs)
**Data**: historical props (open/close, juice), stat outcomes, injuries/inactives, weather by kickoff, pace/PROE, personnel, OL/DL pressure, coverage tendencies where available, line histories (to compute CLV).  
**Per‑Signal Filters** (examples):  
- **Wind** ≥15 mph outdoors → QB/WR yards unders; FG distance unders.  
- **Usage shift** ≥+20% routes/snaps → target/carry reallocation; exploit early lines.  
- **Pace**: top‑5 vs top‑5, or top‑5 vs bottom‑5 → adjust plays ±5–10; test overs/unders accordingly.  
- **OL–DL**: expected pressure ≥35–40% → QB yards under, sacks over, RB/TE rec over.  
- **Personnel**: 11‑personnel drops below ~40% (or 12/13 spikes) → WR3 unders; TE/RB short targets over.  
- **Divisional rematch**: fade inflated star overs; lean QB under in likely run‑script wins.  
- **Projection gap**: |median − line| ≥ 10% of line → simulate, bet if EV ≥ profile thresholds.

**Metrics**: Win%, ROI (net units), **CLV** (avg line move vs our bet), probability calibration (binning), binomial CIs.  
**OOS Split**: Train 2018–2021 (tune thresholds/weights), test 2022–2024. Treat 2020 cautiously (no‑crowd anomaly).  
**Slices**: Playoffs vs regular, divisional vs non‑divisional, **conference vs non‑conference**.  
**Timing Sensitivity**: Simulate at **open** vs **close**; evaluate value decay; confirm early bets beat close (positive CLV).  
**Stress Tests**: Stake fractions; correlation caps; input noise (weather miss, late inactives); worst‑case clusters.  
**Promotion Criteria**: A signal graduates to **Proven** if OOS win% and ROI significant, CLV positive, and effect persists across slices. Otherwise it remains **Experimental** or is shelved.

## Implementation Map (Bet‑That System)
**Data Ingest** → **Projection & Simulation** → **Signal Adjusters** → **EV & Sizing** → **Selection & Correlation Control** → **Line Shopping & Execution** → **Monitoring & Learning**.

1) **Ingestion Jobs**  
   - **Stats/Usage** (weekly): snaps, routes, target/carry share, personnel %, pace, PROE.  
   - **News/Injuries** (near‑real‑time): inactives, snap counts, role notes.  
   - **Weather** (hourly to kickoff): wind/precip/temp flags, venue context.  
   - **Odds** (multi‑book): lines/juice, movement history; best‑book selector.

2) **Projection Engine**  
   - **Baseline**: aggregated or in‑house player means.  
   - **Mean→Median**: Monte Carlo or parametric conversion to medians and distribution percentiles.  
   - **Outputs**: per‑player distribution, median, P(over/under) at any line.

3) **Signal Adjusters** (composable, non‑overlapping):  
   - **Pace/Plays** (game‑level volume), **PROE/ED pass%**, **Usage/Injury redistribution**, **Personnel shifts**, **OL–DL pressure (aDOT & efficiency penalties)**, **Coverage funnel**, **Weather**.  
   - Guardrails to avoid **double counting** (e.g., weather and OL both suppress deep passing; cap combined penalty).

4) **EV & Sizing**  
   - Compute EV% from P(win) & price; **fractional Kelly** stake; cap per‑prop & per‑game exposure; enforce **profile thresholds**.

5) **Selection & Correlation**  
   - Filter to bets ≥ threshold; compute pairwise prop correlations; **throttle correlated exposures** (pick best, or split smaller stakes).

6) **Line Shopping & Execution**  
   - Always target best **number** and **price**; route orders to books; validate unchanged line pre‑ticket; re‑calc if moved.  
   - Optional: **early‑week fire** on openers (aggressive); **confirmation mode** closer to kickoff (moderate).

7) **Monitoring & Learning**  
   - Track results, CLV, per‑signal ROI; dashboards; **degrade alerts** when signal underperforms; periodic re‑backtests; calibration checks.  
   - Analyst override inputs (e.g., snap count limits) propagate to projections and audit logs.

## Case Studies (Wins & Fails; incl. playoffs)
> Form: **Context → Signal(s) → Line Path → Outcome → Lesson**

1) **“Wind Wall” (NE @ BUF, 2021 regular season)**  
   **Signal(s):** Severe wind (30–40 mph); pace down; run‑lean.  
   **Line Path:** Allen pass yards ~240.5 → ~220.5; Mac Jones attempts 29.5. We bet **Allen under** early and **Jones under attempts**.  
   **Outcome:** Jones attempted 3 passes; Allen 145 yards → both win comfortably.  
   **Lesson:** Wind is the most reliable weather lever; act early, but unders can retain value even after market moves.

2) **Post‑Star Trade Target Shift (KC Week 1, 2022)**  
   **Signal(s):** Personnel/target redistribution; opponent TE funnel weakness.  
   **Bet:** **Kelce over** rec yards (70.5–72.5).  
   **Outcome:** 121 yards → win.  
   **Lesson:** Translate football changes (target consolidation) directly into prop medians before the market fully adapts.

3) **Correlated Overs in Wild Card (BUF vs MIA, 2022 playoffs)**  
   **Signal(s):** Pace/PROE; opponent softness vs WR.  
   **Bets:** **Allen over TDs** & **Diggs over yards** (correlated).  
   **Outcome:** Both won.  
   **Lesson:** Correlated wins feel great—but enforce caps; one flipped script could sink both.

4) **QB Out, WR Under? Not Always (CLE @ SEA, 2023)** – *Loss*  
   **Signal(s):** Market overreaction to QB injury; matchup still favorable for WR1.  
   **Bet:** **Amari Cooper over** low‑40s (plus money).  
   **Outcome:** 6 yards → loss.  
   **Lesson:** Thin edges + uncertainty ⇒ pass or halve stake. Respect **confidence rules** over contrarian temptations.

5) **Divisional Rematch Unders (NYG @ PHI, 2022 playoffs)**  
   **Signal(s):** Familiarity; likely run‑script when leading.  
   **Bet:** **Hurts under** ~247.5 pass yards.  
   **Outcome:** 154 yards → win.  
   **Lesson:** Rematches + favorite game control often suppress QB volume; star overs can be inflated by prior meeting.

6) **Narrative Trap (CAR @ SEA, 2022)** – *Loss*  
   **Signal(s):** “Hot hand” & weather‑driven run narrative vs soft run D; model neutral.  
   **Bet:** **Foreman over** mid‑70s.  
   **Outcome:** 74 yards → loss by a whisker.  
   **Lesson:** Don’t buy narrative without model backing; if line ticks up from hype, value is likely gone—consider the **under** or pass.

## What’s New vs Public Consensus
- **Median‑first modeling** (simulate distributions) counters the common overs bias from mean‑based thinking.  
- **Multi‑signal confirmation** (pace + usage + matchup) beats single‑trend chasing.  
- **Early scheme deltas** (motion, personnel, PROE shifts) yield edges **weeks** before consensus narratives adjust.  
- **Systematic correlation control** prevents “all‑in on one game script” risk that dooms many card builds.  
- **Continuous CLV tracking** aligns process with market efficiency—an edge should also beat the close over time.

## De‑prioritized / Hype Angles
“Hot hand,” “revenge game,” raw “primetime magic,” and **small‑sample streaks**. Action only when **corroborated** by usage/scheme/matchup data and pricing inefficiency.

---

## Source Families (football‑useful → prop‑ready)
- **Team strategy & efficiency**: season/team chapters (pace, personnel, OL/DL, coverage tendencies), opponent‑adjusted performance.  
- **Preview frameworks**: motion & play‑action usage, strength of schedule, coordinator tendencies, red‑zone usage.  
- **Data APIs**: play‑by‑play, injuries/inactives, weather forecasts, multi‑book odds.  
> *Note:* Some insights are football‑centric; we convert them into **prop‑ready signals** via quantification (thresholds, adjustments, simulations).

## Appendix A — Practical Formulas
- **No‑vig fair price**: Remove juice by normalizing implied probabilities then re‑implying odds; compare to model P(win).  
- **EV%**: EV = P(win) × payout − (1−P(win)); EV% = EV / stake.  
- **Kelly (decimal odds)**: stake_Kelly = (P × (odds−1) − (1−P)) / (odds−1); use a **fraction** (0.25–0.5 typical).  
- **Median via sim**: Draw from fitted distribution (e.g., zero‑inflated log‑normal for yards); 50th percentile is comparison point.  
- **Correlation cap example**: If ρ_QB,WR ≈ 0.7 and max per‑game exposure = 3% bankroll, either (i) pick only one, or (ii) split 1.5% + 1.5%.

## Appendix B — Example Bet Filter (Pseudo)
```
if EV_pct >= profile.min_EV and conf >= profile.min_conf and game_corr <= profile.max_corr:
    size = min(profile.kelly_frac * kelly_size, limits.cap)
    if size >= min_unit: queue_bet()
```
