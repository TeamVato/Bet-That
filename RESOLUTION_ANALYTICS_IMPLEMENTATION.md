  - Downloadable file response

## Key Metrics Tracked

### Resolution Performance
- **Total Resolutions**: Count of all resolved bets
- **Average Resolution Time**: Time from bet creation to resolution
- **Resolution Accuracy**: Percentage of accurate resolutions (based on dispute rate)
- **Dispute Rate**: Percentage of resolved bets that were disputed

### Outcome Analysis
- **Outcome Distribution**: Breakdown of win/loss/push/void results
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of winning bets
- **Loss Rate**: Percentage of losing bets

### User Performance
- **Most Active Resolvers**: Users with highest resolution counts
- **Average Dispute Resolution Time**: Time to resolve disputes

### Trends
- **Resolution Trends**: Daily resolution counts and average times over time
- **Time Distribution**: Breakdown of resolution time categories

## Data Visualization

### Charts and Graphs
1. **Pie Chart**: Outcome distribution with color coding
2. **Bar Chart**: Most active resolvers with resolution counts
3. **Line Chart**: Resolution trends over time
4. **Cards**: Key metrics with icons and color coding

### Interactive Features
- Hover tooltips with detailed information
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Loading states and error handling
- Real-time data refresh

## Filtering and Search

### Available Filters
- **Date Range**: Start and end date filtering
- **Result Type**: Win, loss, push, void
- **Resolver**: Filter by specific user
- **Dispute Status**: Has dispute, no dispute, or all

### Search Capabilities
- Text search across bet details
- Advanced filtering combinations
- Pagination for large datasets

## Export Functionality

### Supported Formats
- **CSV**: Comma-separated values for spreadsheet import
- **JSON**: Structured data for programmatic use

### Export Data Includes
- Bet details (game, market, selection)
- Resolution information (result, time, resolver)
- Dispute information (if applicable)
- Financial data (stake, odds, returns)
- Timestamps and metadata

## Navigation Integration

### Updated Routes
- `/resolution-analytics`: Main analytics dashboard
- `/resolution-history`: Detailed history page
- `/bets/:betId`: Individual bet details (existing)

### Navigation Menu
- Added "Analytics" link to main navigation
- Integrated with existing bet management flow
- Breadcrumb navigation for easy navigation

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Axios** for API communication

### Backend Stack
- **FastAPI** with Python
- **SQLAlchemy** for database operations
- **Pydantic** for data validation
- **PostgreSQL** for data storage

### Key Features
