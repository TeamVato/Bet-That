# Bet-That Quality Audit Report

Date: September 29, 2025

## Executive Summary

- **Current State**: NEEDS WORK
- **Critical Gaps**: 5 major items
- **Time to Production-Ready**: 8-14 hours

## What's Working ✅

### Frontend Quality Infrastructure

- ✅ **ESLint configured** - .eslintrc.json with React/Prettier integration
- ✅ **Prettier configured** - .prettierrc with consistent formatting rules
- ✅ **ESLint & Prettier installed** - Working via `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run format`
- ✅ **E2E Testing** - Playwright configured with dashboard.spec.ts
- ✅ **Package.json scripts** - Dev workflow commands available

### Backend Infrastructure

- ✅ **Makefile exists** - 87 lines with development workflows
- ✅ **Pytest configured** - pytest.ini with FutureWarning filters
- ✅ **Extensive test suite** - 46 test files in /tests/ directory
- ✅ **CI/CD workflows** - 3 GitHub Actions (daily, edges, weekly)
- ✅ **Multiple environments** - Backend, API, main project separation

### Development Tools

- ✅ **Git configured** - .gitignore, clean working tree
- ✅ **Virtual environment** - .venv present
- ✅ **Documentation** - README.md, multiple .md files

## What's Missing ❌ (Priority Order)

### 1. **Python Quality Tools** (Critical)

- ❌ **No pyproject.toml** - Missing centralized Python configuration
- ❌ **No .flake8** - No linting configuration
- ❌ **No requirements-dev.txt** - Quality tools not in dependencies
- ❌ **Black, Flake8, mypy not installed** - Core formatting/linting missing

### 2. **Test Organization** (Critical)

- ❌ **No unit test structure** - Missing backend/tests/unit/
- ❌ **No integration test structure** - Missing backend/tests/integration/
- ❌ **Test coverage unknown** - No coverage reporting configured
- ❌ **Tests scattered** - Mix of /tests/ and backend/tests/ directories

### 3. **Pre-commit Hooks** (High Priority)

- ❌ **No .pre-commit-config.yaml** - No automated quality enforcement
- ❌ **No git hook validation** - Bad code can enter repository

### 4. **CI/CD Quality Gates** (High Priority)

- ❌ **No quality workflow** - GitHub Actions lack linting/testing jobs
- ❌ **No PR quality checks** - No automated quality validation
- ❌ **No test coverage reporting** - No visibility into test health

### 5. **Type Safety** (Medium Priority)

- ❌ **No mypy configuration** - Python type checking missing
- ❌ **No strict TypeScript** - Frontend could be more strict

## Test Coverage Assessment

### Current State

- **Backend**: Unknown% (No coverage tooling configured)
- **Frontend**: Unknown% (Vitest configured but coverage not measured)
- **E2E**: 1 test file (Dashboard only)

### Target Goals

- **Backend**: 80% (Especially edge_engine.py, odds processing)
- **Frontend**: 80% (Component and integration tests)
- **E2E**: 5+ core user journeys

## Technical Debt Analysis

### High-Risk Areas (Based on File Inspection)

1. **Edge Engine** - Complex financial calculations, needs comprehensive testing
2. **Odds Processing** - Data ingestion pipeline, multiple failure modes
3. **API Endpoints** - User-facing interfaces, security concerns
4. **Database Migrations** - Schema changes, data integrity

### Quality Metrics Gaps

- No code coverage measurement
- No complexity analysis
- No dependency vulnerability scanning
- No performance regression testing

## Recommendations

### Top 3 Immediate Actions

1. **Setup Python quality tools** (2-4 hours)
   - Add Black, Flake8, mypy to requirements-dev.txt
   - Create pyproject.toml with tool configurations
   - Update Makefile with quality-check target

2. **Organize test structure** (3-5 hours)
   - Create proper unit/integration test directories
   - Add pytest-cov for coverage reporting
   - Write core business logic tests (edge engine, odds math)

3. **Add pre-commit hooks** (1-2 hours)
   - Prevent bad code from entering repository
   - Enforce consistent formatting automatically
   - Catch common issues before CI

### Production Readiness Blockers

- **Code quality enforcement** - Currently no automated checks
- **Test coverage** - Unknown risk in core business logic
- **Type safety** - Runtime errors possible from type mismatches

### Success Criteria

After fixes, these commands should work:

```bash
make quality-check  # ✅ All linters pass
make test-all       # ✅ Tests pass with >60% coverage
git commit          # ✅ Pre-commit hooks run successfully
```

## Risk Assessment

- **Current Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Main Concerns**:
  - Financial calculations not thoroughly tested
  - No quality gates preventing bad deployments
  - Manual quality processes prone to human error
- **Mitigation**: Follow Phase 1-3 of implementation plan immediately
